## 👾 Terminal + Fastfetch
> [!NOTE] 
> If you just wanna fully use it just like I'm using then I recommend watchng the video. If you just want the config for Fastfetch then just paste the config where **your** Fastfetch config is located. If you have a PowerShell profile then just add your location and other stuff in your profile yourself as idk what you got.
>
> If you see **"execution of scripts is disabled on this system"**, don’t panic! Just open PowerShell as Administrator and run: 
> `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force`
>
> Also if you notice that the ASCII art is not showing then try editing `"source": "C:/Users/%USERPROFILE%/.config/fastfetch/ascii.txt"` to `"source": "%USERPROFILE%/.config/fastfetch/ascii.txt"`. That should fix it. [**Credits**](https://github.com/SleepyCatHey/Ultimate-Win11-Setup/issues/1#issue-3498937609).
>
> If you want to add FastFetch to CMD as well, then please check out this [**issue**](https://github.com/SleepyCatHey/Ultimate-Win11-Setup/issues/9#issue-3958846174). Big thanks to [**Augtive85YT**](https://github.com/Augtive85YT).
 
Fastfetch is a neofetch-like tool for fetching system information and displaying it in a visually appealing way. It is written mainly in C, with a focus on performance and customizability.

**⚙️ Installation:**  
You can follow the steps below, or jump to the [**setup video**](https://youtu.be/z3NpVq-y6jU) if you want your terminal to look 1:1 to mine.
- Install [**Fastfetch**](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/releases) and I believe you already got the **Windows terminal** installed.
- Copy the config file for your Terminal [**here**](https://github.com/SleepyCatHey/Ultimate-Win11-Setup/tree/main/Terminal), PowerShell profile from [**here**](https://github.com/SleepyCatHey/Ultimate-Win11-Setup/tree/main/PowerShell) and Fastfetch config from [**here**](https://github.com/SleepyCatHey/Ultimate-Win11-Setup/tree/main/Fastfetch)
- Remove the codes from the settings.json file in **your terminal** and paste the one you just copied from above. Do the same thing for your PowerShell profile.
- Create a **.config** *hidden* file in your C:\Users\%USERPROFILE% and create a folder called **fastfetch** inside. Copy the config and ascii code you just downloaded and paste it in that folder.
- Change the %USERPROFILE% from the config file in the fastfetch folder and the PowerShell profile with **your username**..
- Restart your terminal and your done. If this feel complicated just watch the [**setup video**](https://youtu.be/z3NpVq-y6jU).
